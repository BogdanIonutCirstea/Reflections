When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I would want to share my projects with other people, to access them from other computers or to have 
backup storage.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

For pretty the same reasons you would want to commit manually rather than automatically: basically more control and flexibility.
